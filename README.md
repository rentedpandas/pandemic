# Pandemic - Made by Pantect

### Pantect's Mission
“To donate cloth masks and spread awareness of mask usage, with a belief that communal dedication will eliminate COVID-19”

### How to use this repo
Welcome to Github! We will be using Github to fetch, commit, and push edits to the pandemic.html file, which is where the storyline exists. You do not need prior HTML or JavaScript experience to use this; it is all handled from Twine.

In order to contribute to this project, follow instructions clearly so that we do not lose progress.

### Prerequisites
To get started, download Twine from [here](https://twinery.org).

Open Twine for the first time. You can skip the tutorial. You need to change a few settings to match with the script writing setup that we are using. Click `Formats` on the right hand side, and change it to `SugarCube 2.x.x`. The current version is `2.34.1`.

Make sure that you have a Github account. It's pretty easy to register since it's free. You can sign up with your Lawrenceville email address or personal email address, your preference.

### Contributing
1. On the main page, on the top right hand corner, click the button that says fork. This will immediately make a copy of the repository for you.
2. There is a big green button in the middle that will now say "Code" with a download button. Download the file as a zip, then open the file in your Files app. You should see a file that says `pandemic.html`.
3. Go to the Twine app. On the right, click on `Import from File`. Select this file. It will automatically import into Twine.
4. Now, you can start contributing. To edit a node, double click and start writing the script.
5. When you are done, save the file by clicking the home icon on the bottom of Twine. Click the gear icon next to pandemic, and select `Publish to file`. It will now save as `pandemic.html`. Take care to not mix up an older version of pandemic.html! It may be easier to save it to where you downloaded the file, and overwrite it.
6. Push your updates to Github by going to your repository, uploading the file by selecting `Add File` and `Upload File`.
7. After doing this, go to the `Pull requests` tab. Click `Create pull request`.
8. Set your title to `[DATE]`, and add any information that you would like to the description section.
9. Click `create pull requset`.
10. And you're all set!
